// V 1.1.1
New features:
	-each gizmo now has an associated object collection and object layer mask. Objects that are masked will not be
	manipulated by that gizmo;

Improvements:
	-added toggle button which can be used to turn playmode GUI hints on/off. This toggle button resides in
	the Runtime Editor Application mono Inspector;
	-added ability to toggle camera scrolling on/off;
	-by default all object layers are now selectable;

// V 1.1
New features:
	-layer selection masks (can be configured from the 'EditorObjectSelection' inspector);
	-added 'OnGizmoDragStart', 'OnGizmoDragUpdate' and 'OnGizmoDragEnd' events to the 'Gizmo' class (documentation chapter 6.1);
	
Improvements:
	-Unity style camera movement using the WASD and QE keys (camera speed can be controlled from the 'EditorCamera' inspector);

Bug fixes:
	-fixed bug which was causing gizmos to render incorrectly for different viewport offset/size configurations;
	-fixed bug which was causing objects to get deselected when a UI element was clicked;

Removed:
	-Bootstrap scene. Prefabs should be used instead for a much cleaner and comfortable solution;

// V 1.0.7
New features:
	-camera focus on object selection;
	-camera orbit around focus point;
	-invert camera pan axes;
	-added possibility to disable the object selection mechanism;
	-it is now possible to customize the object selection mechanism;
	-3 selection modes are now available;
	-added Bootstrap scene;

Bug fixes:
	-the system now performs any necessary cleanup and performs any needed actions when
	 a new scene is loaded at runtime (e.g. clear object selection, disable gizmos etc);
	-fixed vertex snapping bug which occured when trying to snap a parent object to one of
	 its children.

// V 1.0.1
New features:
	-object selection masks;
	-added support for mesh colliders;
	-the 'ObjectColliderAttachmentSettings' class now contains 3 new properties which allow
	 you to specify what types of objects should be ignored during the collider attachment
	 process;
	-added support for camera smooth zoom and smooth pan.

Bug fixes:
	-fixed bug which was happening in Unity 5.3.1. This was related to calling 'DontDestroyOnLoad' from
	 the editor. For some reason, in Unity 5.3.1, this makes your objects dissappear from the hierarchy
	 view. The fix involved calling this function at runtime where it was necessary.

// V 1.0 - First release
